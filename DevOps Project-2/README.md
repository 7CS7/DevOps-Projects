# Automated WebSite Deployment using Docker

![](images/Git-Docker-Jenkins.png)

In this Project I have used the Git/GitHub, Jenkins and Docker and integrated all these technologies to create an automated system for AutoDeployment. For building this project I have used my another account ie, <a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26-DevOps/Task-2">Abhinav-26-DevOps</a>, where I practise DevOps tasks.
If you are new to Git/GitHub, Jenkins, WebServer, I have written a well documented article on these topics in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhinavdubey26/">LinkedIn Profile</a> and shown how we can configure these in our system and integrate these technologies.
