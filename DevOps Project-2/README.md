# Automated WebSite Deployment using Docker

![](images/Git-Docker-Jenkins.png)

In this Project I have used the Git/GitHub, Jenkins and Docker and integrated all these technologies to create an automated system for AutoDeployment. For building this project I have used my another account ie, <a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26-DevOps/Task-2">Abhinav-26-DevOps</a>, where I practise DevOps tasks.
