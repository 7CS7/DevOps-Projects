<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/DevOps-Integration/tree/master/DevOps%20Project-1">Project-1 : Automated WebDevelopment Environment</a><br>
In this Project I have created an Automated Web Development Environment integrating Git/GitHub, Jenkins and Httpd WebServer in RHEL-8. In this Project the developer just need to Commit the code from his local repository, GitHub will automatically send the code to Jenkins using webhooks as soon as there will be any commit in GitHub repo, and Jenkins will then automatically launch the website into apache2 httpd server which is setup in RHEL-8.<br>
