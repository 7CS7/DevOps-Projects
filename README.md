# DevOps-Integration
In this repository I will show some of the concepts of Automation by DevOps and integrating it with different technologies like Git/Github, Jenkins, Docker, etc. with well Documented README.md file.

# Website
Directory "Website" consists of all the files of the Website that I used for creating a Web Development Environment by interating Git/Github, Jenkins and apache Web Server in Redhat 8. I have written a well documented article in my LinkedIn Handle explaining how we can create an web development environment using these technologies.
