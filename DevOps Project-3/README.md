# Containerization Within Container

![](images/docker-in-docker.png)

In this Project I have used the concepts of Docker which I learned during the Training <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abhinavdubey26_docker-expertise-activity-6675343126288244737-TgyB"><b>Expertise in Docker</b></a> under the guidance of <b>World Record Holder Vimal Daga</b> sir. I have used these concepts to create an <b>Automated WebSite Deployment</b> as I have created in the <a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/DevOps-Integration/tree/master/DevOps%20Project-2">Previous Project</a>.

# How it is Different
This Project, and the Project which I made in previous repository performs the same tasks but with a different approach. The advantage of using this apprach is that we can easily ship this complete project to where ever we want to run it. I have created a Jenkins-image using DOCKERFILE so that all my work will be saved into this and it won't effect my project. Also I have uploaded this jenkins-image to my <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/alex43">DockerHub</a> profile.
